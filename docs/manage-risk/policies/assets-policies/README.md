# Assets policies

## Overview

With Snyk AppRisk policies, you can easily automate the process of adding business context and receiving notifications.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
After a policy is created, it is run in a maximum of 3 hours after creation, then once every 3 hours.&#x20;

If your policy is set to run daily, then the policy is run 3 hours after the 24-hour period ends. You can always manually run a policy by using the Run button.
{% endhint %}

Access the Snyk AppRisk policies by positioning yourself at the Group level, selecting **Policies**, then **Assets**.

The following video presents an overview of the types of policies you can create from the Policies view.

{% hint style="info" %}
[Manage assets](../../../manage-assets/) and [assets policies](./) are interconnected. Before setting up any new policy, ensure you have reviewed and filtered your assets from the Inventory menu.
{% endhint %}

## **Use Cases**

You can create policies for organizing the assets, classifying them, and always being up to date with the latest information about an asset.\
Common use cases for policies include:

* [New asset notifications](use-cases-for-policies/notification-policy-use-case.md)
* [Asset classification](use-cases-for-policies/classification-policy-use-case.md)
* [Asset tagging](use-cases-for-policies/tagging-policy-use-case.md)
* [Coverage control](use-cases-for-policies/coverage-control-policy-use-case.md)

### New asset notifications

&#x20;Notify members of the AppSec team when new assets meeting certain criteria are discovered. For example, you may send a Slack message to the infra team if new repository assets that leverage Terraform as a technology are detected by Snyk AppRisk.

When setting up a notification action (email or Slack) for a policy, you can include a link to the relevant assets. Each notification will list all the assets impacted by the policy. You can view the assets individually, or you can see a summary of all the assets by clicking the **Click Here** option in the notification. The list of assets displayed in the email notification is automatically generated.

### Asset classification

Classify repository assets according to their business criticality from A (most critical) to D (least critical), based on asset properties such as name and tags. For example, you might indicate that any repositories that contain “customer-portal” in the name should be classified as A, given that the customer-portal app holds sensitive data.

### Asset tagging

&#x20;Categorize and label repository assets with flexible tags, which can be used to filter the asset inventory.

### Security coverage

Monitor if your assets are scanned by the selected security products. You can select one or multiple security products and also specify a timeframe for when the last scan should have taken place.
