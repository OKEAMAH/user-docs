# Parameters for troubleshooting and providing your own certificate with Helm

To troubleshoot SSL inspection issues, you can set the `tlsRejectUnauthorized` parameter to `disable`.

```
--set tlsRejectUnauthorized=disable
```

To trust your own Certificate Authority, you can pass a certificate file name to the `caCert` parameter. The file must reside within the Helm chart directory.

```
--set caCert=<CERT_NAME>
```

Alternatively, provide the content of the certificate to the `caCertFile` parameter.

```
--set caCertFile="-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
```

To troubleshoot CA trust issues, you can set the `disableCaCertTrust` parameter to `true`.

```
--set disableCaCertTrust=true
```

If you want your Broker to run as an HTTPS server, you can pass the files to the `httpsCert` and `httpsKey` parameters. The files must reside within the Helm chart directory.

```
--set httpsCert=<CERT_NAME> --set httpsKey=<CERT_KEY>
```
