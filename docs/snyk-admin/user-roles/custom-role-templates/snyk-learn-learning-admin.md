To use [Snyk Learn Access Controls](../../../getting-started/snyk-learn/snyk-learn-access-controls.md) beyond the default Snyk Group and Organization Admin roles, a Snyk Group Admin must create a custom role.

To create this role, enable the following permissions in the relevant categories:

## Organization-level permissions

<table><thead><tr><th>Permission</th><th data-type="checkbox">Enabled</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>View Organization assignments</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Edit Organization assignments</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Create Organization assignments</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Delete Organization assignments</td><td>true</td></tr></tbody></table>
