# Snyk Learn Reports and Assignments

## Reports

Snyk Learn Reports allow you to gain insights into which lessons and lesson categories users view for each Organization.

Snyk Learn also provides reports for learning path completion where you can see the users current progress for each available learning path and when they last completed it.

Reporting is available on a per-org basis, showing the Learning Path and Lesson progress for users within that Organization.&#x20;

Lesson progress is associated with the individual user, meaning that if they are members of multiple Organizations, their lesson progress will be the same across all Organizations.

All reports can be downloaded to a CSV file. The Lesson Overview report CSV contains the historical completions and current progress. The Learning Path overview report CSV contains the current learning path progress and the last completion date.

#### Product update training for the development team

Ensure developers are trained on new product features. Admins can create assignments that include product training content on new features. If significant updates require retraining, the admin can use the progress reset feature.

#### Compliance training for new regulations

Ensure employees complete training on new regulatory requirements. Admins can create assignments that cover the effective period of new regulations, including content required by compliance. The admin can use the progress reset feature to reset previous progress and mandate updated training.

### Who can be assigned Snyk Learn lessons?

Assignments are linked to the individual user.
