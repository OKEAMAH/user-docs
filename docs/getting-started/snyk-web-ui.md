Each integration can be configured to run on more than one profile. This is helpful when retrieving data from multiple instances within the same source.&#x20;

You can add a new profile by following these steps:

2. Click **Add profile**.
3. Fill in the configuration fields and click **Done**.

{% endhint %}

When you log in to an existing account and select an Organization, the Web UI opens the Dashboard for that Organization:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (503).png" alt="Snyk Dashboard, the view when you log in and select an Organization"><figcaption><p>Snyk Dashboard, the view when you log in and select an Organization</p></figcaption></figure>

The **Pending tasks** section shows the next chores to be handled for the Projects in a Snyk Organization.&#x20;

#### View Projects

Use the links for Projects on the Dashboard to explore and manage the metadata, retest, and fix options for the Target files in your Projects. Each link opens a Project details page where you can view the Project **Overview**, or switch to the **History** and **Settings** tabs.

See [Snyk Projects](../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/) for more information.

#### Fix vulnerabilities

Snyk tracks and flags Pull Requests (PRs) in the top-most vulnerable Projects, including:

* PRs that can be raised to fix vulnerabilities in some of the most vulnerable Projects.
* PRs that have already been raised by or through Snyk and are open and awaiting review.

For Projects with the **Fix vulnerabilities** link, use this link to view Project details with an option to open a fix PR. See [Snyk Fix Pull or Merge Requests](../scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/snyk-pull-or-merge-requests/) for more details.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently, Snyk tracks and flags PRs in GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and Bitbucket Cloud only, and only for the top-most vulnerable Projects. If you use another SCM, the **Pending tasks** section shows PRs that can be raised but not PRs that have already been raised.
{% endhint %}

#### Top vulnerable projects

Similarly, the **Top vulnerable projects** section shows the [Snyk Projects](../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/) assessed as the most vulnerable, with similar functions available as the **Pending tasks** section.&#x20;

On the Settings tab, you can also look up the unique Project ID and deactivate or delete a Project.
