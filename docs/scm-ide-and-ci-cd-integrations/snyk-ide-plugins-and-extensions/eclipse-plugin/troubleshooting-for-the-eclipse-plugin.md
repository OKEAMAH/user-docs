# Troubleshooting for the Eclipse plugin

{% hint style="warning" %}
Snyk plugins are not supported on any operating system that has reached End Of Life (EOL) with the distributor.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## General troubleshooting

For general troubleshooting, see the [IDE troubleshooting pages](../troubleshooting-ides/).

## Logs

To determine where plugin logs are stored, navigate to **Preferences** > **Language Servers** > **Logs** and find the **Snyk Language Server** row in Eclipse. As the Language Server can be disabled, you may need to enable it to retrieve the logs. You will find the logs either in the console or in the file based on the preference set.

To see additional plugin error logs:

1. Navigate to **Window** > **Show View** > **Others...**.
2. In **type text filer,** search for **Error Log**.
3. Click **Open** to see the error log tab. If you group the tab view by plugin (three dots menu in the top right corner > **Group By** > **Plug-in**), the `io.snyk.eclipse.plugin` row shows any plugin errors.

The log level can be set in the Eclipse settings using the environment variable `SNYK_LOG_LEVEL` , for example,`SNYK_LOG_LEVEL=debug.`

Determine the installation path of the Language Server, as displayed in the plugin settings. The Language Server logs can be found in the same directory with the file name `snyk-ls.log`

When working on the terminal, **be careful to escape spaces in the folder path**.

## Proxy settings

Ensure that you read the Snyk [Eclipse documentation](./).

### &#x20;Details to address

* Determine whether the issue occurs on the CLI terminal, outside of the IDE.
* Prefereably, use the latest Snyk CLI version.
* Use the debug option to obtain the user's `snyk test` and `snyk monitor` output.
* Set the proxy variable in the command line: s`et http_proxy=<http….>`

### &#x20;Proxy setting confirmation

In Eclipse, go to **Windows → Preferences → General → Network Connections**.

Ensure the configured proxy settings are identical to the ones that have been set in the CLI terminal.

The proxy settings can be overridden by adding the settings through the Snyk preferences **Additional Environment**:

`https_proxy=http://your-proxy.com:8080`

## Issues with installing the Eclipse plugin

If you are facing issues installing Eclipse plugins, it might be due to the incompatibility of the JDK version used by Eclipse. This can be resolved by running Eclipse with JDK 17 or a higher version. Follow these steps:

1. Download and install JDK 17 or a higher version.
2. Download and install Eclipse IDE from the official Eclipse website.
3. After Eclipse IDE is installed, navigate to the Eclipse installation directory and locate the `eclipse.ini`file.
4.  Open the `eclipse.ini` file and add the following to it:

    `vm {path to JDK 17 or higher version}\bin`

    Ensure you replace `{path to JDK 17 or higher version}` with the actual path where JDK 17 or higher version is installed on your system.
5. Save and close the `eclipse.ini` file.
6. Launch the Eclipse IDE using the usual method.
7. After Eclipse is launched, go to **Window > Preferences > Java > Installed JREs**.
8. Click on **Add** and select the **path to JDK 17 or higher version** installed on your system.
9. Click **OK** and close the Preferences dialogue box.

You are now ready to install any Eclipse plugin of your choice.

An example follows showing how the `eclipse.ini` file could look like after adding the path to the JDK 17 or higher version. The last line is the relevant change; the rest of the file, can, but does not need to be touched.

`-startup plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.6.200.v20210416-2027.jar --launcher.library plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.win32.win32.x86_64_1.2.200.v20210429-1609 -product org.eclipse.epp.package.jee.product -showsplash org.eclipse.epp.package.common --launcher.defaultAction openFile --launcher.appendVmargs -vmargs -Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=11 -Xms256m -Xmx2048m --add-modules=ALL-SYSTEM --add-opens=java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.io=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED -vm C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-17.0.1\\bin`

Ensure you replace `C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Java\\\\jdk-17.0.1\\\\bin` with the actual path where the JDK 17 or higher version is installed on your system.

## Application development and JDK version <a href="#application-development" id="application-development"></a>

While running Eclipse with JDK 17 or a higher version can resolve issues related to plugin installation, it is important to note that it may not be compatible with all versions of Java used for developing applications. Depending on the specific requirements of your application, you may need to use a different version of Java, such as JDK 8 or 11, for development purposes. Be sure to consult the documentation and requirements of your application before making any changes to your Java environment.

Note also that while you can install multiple versions of JDK on your system, you can use only one version at a time. This means that if you need to switch between different versions of JDK for different projects, you must update the Eclipse configuration accordingly.

To change the JDK version used by Eclipse for a specific project, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in Eclipse.
2. Right-click on the project and select **Properties**.
3. In the Properties dialogue box, go to J**ava Build Path > Libraries**.
4. Locate the **JRE System Library** and click on it to expand the options.
5. Click on **Edit** and select the desired JDK version from the list of installed JREs.
6. Click **Finish** to save the changes.

By following these steps, you can easily switch between different JDK versions for different projects in Eclipse. It's important to ensure that you are using the correct version of JDK for each project, as this can impact the compatibility and functionality of your application.

## Windows Defender warns of running a binary

Windows Defender can sometimes block or issue warnings when running Go binaries. This can happen for various reasons, for example, the binary may be unrecognized or have behavior that triggers the antivirus software.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following solutions:

* Add an exclusion: Exclude the Go binary or the directory containing the binary from Windows Defender's scanning. This can help prevent false positives and allow the binary to run without interference.
* Disable Windows Defender temporarily: If adding an exclusion does not solve the problem, you can temporarily disable Windows Defender while running the Go binary. However, exercise caution when disabling antivirus software and ensure that you have other security measures in place.
* Submit the binary to Microsoft: If you believe the detection is a false positive, you can report it to Microsoft. They have a process for submitting files to be reviewed, and if confirmed as a false positive, the detection may be updated in future antivirus definitions.

## **Signing Information for Jars**

If you want to verify the correct provenance of your plugin, verify the signing details from the Eclipse dialog using this data.
