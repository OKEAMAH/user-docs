# GitHub Server App

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Release status and feature availability**

The GitHub Server App is in [Closed Beta](../../getting-started/snyk-release-process.md). This feature must be enabled using a feature flag on the Group or Organization level. Contact your account team if you are interested in getting access.

The GitHub Server App is available to Snyk Enterprise plan customers. If you have a Legacy Business plan, contact [Snyk support](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us) for access. See the [Plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans/) page for details.

This feature is not yet supported for Snyk Broker.\
As Snyk does not have static IP addresses, this integration will not work with IP Whitelisting in GitHub.
{% endhint %}

When you want to add new integrations to your Snyk account you need to first decide the level type at which you want to install the integration.

* [Group level ](github-server-app.md#group-level-snyk-apprisk-integrations)- Add integrations to your Snyk application that will be available for your Snyk AppRisk Essentials or Snyk AppRisk Pro.&#x20;
* [Organization level](github-server-app.md#organization-level-snyk-integrations) - Add integrations for your Snyk application that will be available for all Snyk products, except Snyk AppRisk.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to set up integrations for Snyk AppRisk, use the Integrations menu at the Group level.

### GitHub Server App benefits

The Snyk GitHub Server App improves on many features compared to the Snyk GitHub Enterprise integration, including role-based granular access control, increased API rate limits, and the creation of an entry point for expanded and enhanced developer experiences.

* **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Compliance**: With the GitHub Server App, the access control mechanism is decoupled from individual user accounts. Instead, it is associated with the app entity itself. This separation allows for better management and enforcement of RBAC policies, as access control is handled at the application level rather than being tied to individual user accounts.
* **Granular access control**: The GitHub Server App allows for fine-grained control over access permissions at the repository level.&#x20;
* **Increased API rate limit**: The GitHub Server App provides higher rate limits, allowing Snyk to make a larger number of API requests. This increased limit will assist in handling large-scale use cases, such as monorepos with a large number of Projects, GitHub organizations with a large number of repositories, and more.
* **Enabler for an enhanced developer experience:**
  * Pull request checks: The Checks tab experience in GitHub is exclusively accessible through the GitHub Cloud App, enabling an SCM native experience as part of potential future PR check workflow improvements.
  * Fix and upgrade pull requests: Pull requests initiated by Snyk are performed directly by the GitHub App rather than a service account.

You'll be redirected to your GitHub instance in order to register the app. You can choose the name of the GitHub App that will be registered on your instance.

You are then asked to authorize the app to act on your userâ€™s behalf. The app uses this information to check which GitHub organizations you are authorized to install the app in.

Specify whether you wish to install the app in all or a select number of the repositories belonging to the selected GitHub organization, then click **Install & Authorize**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The GitHub Server App will lose access to Snyk if it is uninstalled from the GitHub organization or if the repositories to which the app instance has access are edited.
