Backstage is a service catalog that allows users to add metadata or annotations to their repositories, helping to organize and categorize the available resources for easier navigation and understanding. You can leverage your SCM integration to pull metadata associated with Backstage catalog files into Snyk AppRisk.

You can use the Backstage catalog file for GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, BitBucket Cloud, and BitBucket on-prem SCM integrations.

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk AppRisk parses the fields of the detected file using the default field names unless an alternate field name is specified.
